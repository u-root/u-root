Read in PT_LOAD segments from elf and create segments.


OK, try this: get kexec, build purgatory.ro, copy it here.
ld -Tdata=0x48000 -Ttext=0x40000 -o purgatory purgatory.ro


This gets us a blob linked at 40000. Then create the trampoline
xxd -i purgatory
etc.etc.


ld -e entry64 -Tdata=0x48000 -Ttext=0x40000 -o purgatory purgatory.ro

This gets us to console_init in the kernel, at which point it explodes again. The lgdt and %ds setup is essential, patrickg was right.
