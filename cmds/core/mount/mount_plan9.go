// Mount mounts servename on old, with an optional keypattern spec
//
// Synopsis:
//	 mount [ option ... ] servename old [ spec ]
//
// Description:
//	Mount modifies the name space of the current
//	process and other processes in the same name space group
//	(see https://9p.io/magic/man2html/1/bind).
//
// Options:
//	–b:	Both files must be directories. Add the new directory to the beginning of the union directory represented by the old file.
//	–a:	Both files must be directories. Add the new directory to the end of the union directory represented by the old file.
//	–c:	This can be used in addition to any of the above to permit creation in a union directory.
//		When a new file is created in a union directory, it is placed in the first element of the union that has been bound or mounted with the –c flag.
//		If that directory does not have write permission, the create fails.
//	-C:	By default, file contents are always retrieved from the server.
//		With this option, the kernel may instead use a local cache to satisfy read(5) requests for files accessible through this mount point.
