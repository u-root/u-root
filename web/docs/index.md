## What is U-root?

<p class="content">
	U-root is an embeddable root file system intended to be placed in a FLASH device as part 
    of the firmware image, along with a Linux kernel. Unlikely most embedded root file systems, 
    which consist of large binaries, U-root only has five: an init program and four Go compiler binaries.
