This code of conduct outlines our rules and expectations for everybody participating in the U-root community.


= Mailing list and chat etiquette =

We have a friendly and productive atmosphere on our mailing lists, development / code review tools and IRC chat rooms. Our principles evolve around the following:

* It's not the user's fault if something goes wrong.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* People who intentionally insult others (users, developers, corporations, other projects, or the U-root project itself) will be dealt with. See policy below.
* We are dealing with hardware with lots of undocumented pitfalls. It is quite possible that you did everything right, but U-root or its tools still won’t work for you.

Refrain from insulting anyone or the group they belong to. Remember that people might be sensitive to other things than you are.

Most of our community members are not native English speakers, thus misunderstandings can (and do) happen. Always assume that others are friendly and may have picked less-than-stellar wording by accident.

If you feel that you have been treated unfairly, we want to hear about it so we can handle the situation. Please contact our arbitration team directly: They will listen to you. If you don't get a response within a few days, your mail was probably lost. Please resend your mail to another member of the arbitration team in that case.


= Unacceptable Behavior =

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

Examples of behaviors we do not accept in our community: 

* harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability;
* inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual advances;
* deliberate intimidation, stalking or following;
* harassing photography or recording;
* sustained disruption of talks or other events.

Using this code of conduct aggressively against other people in the community might also be harassment. Be considerate when enforcing the code of conduct and always try to listen to both sides before passing judgment.

= Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior =

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event). Community organizers can be part of the arbitration team, or organizers of events and online communities.

= If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior =

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify someone from the arbitration team immediately.


= Addressing Grievances =

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the arbitration team with a concise description of your grievance.


= Scope =

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues—online and in-person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.


= Contact info =

Our arbitration team consists of the following people
