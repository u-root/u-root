FAQs So, why \"u-root\"? It's to reflect a universal root, you can mount on every local and get a userland portable (it's a goal). Any publications?

Its work is also done, so it is resting. the other gophers can make more copies of u-root; hence the u-root logo on their chest. the highest gopher is showing how u-root is a good root file system for a VM. the U itself is a stylized tree, evocative of roots.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#u-root","text":"u-root is an embeddable root file system intended to be placed in a flash device as part of the firmware image, along with a Linux kernel.
