// The linux package loads bzImage-based Linux kernels using the kexec_load
// system call.
//
// Callers may choose a 64bit or 32bit purgatory to use at runtime.
//
// kexec_load is conceptually simple to use: give it some code segments and an
// entry point, then tell the kernel to jump to the entry point.
//
// The kernel's contract on x86_64 is that kexec will jump to the entry point
// in 64bit mode with identity-mapped page tables and unspecified garbage in
// registers.
//
// Theoretically, one could just load the ELF segments of a kernel into
// kexec_load, give it the entry point, and let it run. However, a loaded Linux
// kernel may expect to be loaded in either 32bit or 64bit mode and expects an
// argument in rsi: a pointer to the Linux boot_params struct.
//
// To drop into the right addressing mode and pass this argument to the kernel,
// some additional code is placed before the execution of the new Linux kernel
// called a purgatory. So it will go: old kernel jumps to purgatory jumps to
// new kernel.
//
// Our purgatory will only have these three responsibilities:
// - drop to the intended addressing mode (32bit or 64bit)
// - set the right rsi parameters
// - jump to the entry point.
//
// The purgatory has to be supplied by us as part of kexec_load, and set up to
// do the right thing. Two purgatories written in Assembly are part of this
// package: one that sets up the Linux args and remains in 64bit mode, and one
// that sets up the Linux args and drops to 32bit mode.
//
// ## History of kexec
//
// The original kexec was designed to work with ELF, and was even hooked
// into the exec system call: starting a new kernel was as easy as typing
// ./vmlinux
// i.e., kexec was truly just a variant on exec!
//
// In the earliest kexec, as in all the early "kernel boots kernel" implementations (1),
// (and still in Plan 9 today), the kernel directly loaded, and started, the
// next kernel. For a number of reasons, kexec introduced the concept of a
// purgatory. The purgatory in principle is both simple and elegant: a small
// bit of code, supplied by user space, that manages the transition from one
// kernel to the next, and vanishes.
//
// The purgatory has a few main responsibilities:
// o (optionally) copy the new kernel over top of the old kernel
// o do any special device setup that neither kernel can manage (mainly console)
// o run a SHA256 over the kernel
// o communicate arguments to the new kernel (on x86, assembly linux params at 0x90000)
// o be able to return to the caller if things go wrong
// o run anywhere, because we may be booting a 16-bit kernel
//
// That last item is the one that causes a lot of trouble. In 2000, systems
// with 16 MiB were still common, Linux kernels had to load at 0x100000,
// memtest86 had to load in the low 640k, and finding a place to put the
// purgatory required that it be a position independent program. Rather than
// being written as such, it was instead compiled as a relocatable ELF, the
// relocation being done at kexec time. I.e., kexec includes a link step.
//
// Because processors have changed a lot since 2000, when kexec was first
// written, these old assumptions are worth re-examining.
//
// First, systems that use kexec come with at least 1 GiB of memory nowadays.
// Further, newer kernels always avoid using the low 1MiB, since buggy BIOSes
// might corrupt memory. Finally, nobody cares about booting 16-bit kernels any
// more -- even memtest86 runs as a Linux binary. Hence: we can always get
// space in the low 1MiB for the purgatory, and in fact we can assume that
// memory is available at 0x3000. The low 640K must alway be there. That means
// we can link the purgatory to run at a fixed place -- since most kexec users
// load it at a fixed place anyway.
//
// Second, with relocatable kernels, the copy function is no longer needed.
//
// Third, we can dispense with ideas of returning. If things are so messed up
// that we can not kexec, it is likely time to reset the machine. Should we
// desire to implement return later, however, we need not use the messy
// mechanisms in the current purgatories to save registers. If we mark the
// function with a returnstwice attribute, gcc will use caller-save semantics
// for the call, not callee-save, removing any need to worry about saving
// registers.
//
// Hence, we can, should we care, arrange for the purgatory right up to the
// point that it drops to 32-bit unpaged mode. Because the number of operations
// from 32-bit to calling the next kernel are so few, we do not feel it is
// necessary to return past that point.
//
// Fourth, parameter passing is unnecessarily messy in the current purgatories.
// We can rewrite that contract: if we consider the first 8 uint64_t in the
// purgatory, the first can be used for a relative jump around the next 7, and
// those seven quadwords can be used for parameter passing.
//
// These changes should let us:
// o build the purgatory as a non-relative ELF, i.e. a statically linked program with one ELF program (segment)
// o and link it at 0x3000; the code was putting the current relative ELF in a fixed place anyway
// o use the ELF program header to tell us where to put the purgatory
// o communicate arguments in the seven quadwords mentioned above
// o rather than one does-it-all purgatory as we have today, we can provide several variants
//   so we get one suited to the job at hand.
//
// This should result in a dramatically simpler purgatory implementation. Also,
// being much simpler, it can be entirely Go assembly, obviating the need for a
// C compiler. This preserves a desired property of u-root: that it can always
// be built with only the Go toolchain.
