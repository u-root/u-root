# Contributing to u-root

We need help with this project. Contributions are very welcome. See the [roadmap](roadmap.md), open [issues](https://github.com/u-root/u-root/issues), and join us in [Slack](CONTRIBUTING.md#communication) to talk about your cool ideas for the project.

## Developer Sign-Off

For purposes of tracking code-origination, we follow a simple sign-off
process.  If you can attest to the [Developer Certificate of
Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) then you append in each git
commit text a line such as:
```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <username@youremail.com>
```

## Coding Style

The ``u-root`` project aims to follow the standard formatting recommendations
and language idioms set out in the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
guide, for example [formatting](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#formatting)
and [names](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#names).

`gofmt` and `golint` are law, although this is not automatically enforced
yet and some housecleaning needs done to achieve that.

We have a few rules not covered by these tools:

- Standard imports are separated from other imports. Example:
    ```
    import (
      "regexp"
      "time"

      dhcp "github.com/krolaw/dhcp4"
    )
    ```

## Patch Format

Well formatted patches aide code review pre-merge and code archaeology in
the future.  The abstract form should be:
```
<component>: Change summary

More detailed explanation of your changes: Why and how.
Wrap it to 72 characters.
See [here] (http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
for some more good advices.

Signed-off-by: <contributor@foo.com>
```

An example from this repo:
```
tcz: quiet it down

It had a spurious print that was both annoying and making
boot just a tad slower.

## General Guidelines

We want to implement some of the common commands that exist in upstream projects and elsewhere, but we don't need to copy broken behavior. CLI compatibility with existing implementations isn't required. We can add missing functionality and remove broken behavior from commands as needed.

U-root needs to fit onto small flash storage, (eg. 8 or 16MB SPI). Be cognizant of of how your work is increasing u-root's footprint. The current goal is to keep the BB mode `lzma -9` compressed initramfs image under 3MB.

## Pull Requests

We accept GitHub pull requests.

Fork the project on GitHub, work in your fork and in branches, push
these to your GitHub fork, and when ready, do a GitHub pull requests
against https://github.com/u-root/u-root.

`u-root` uses [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)
for its dependency management. Please run `dep ensure`, `dep prune`, and commit Gopkg.toml, Gopkg.lock and vendor/ changes before opening a pull request.

Every commit in your pull request needs to be able to build and pass the CI tests.

If the pull request closes an issue please note it as: `"Fixes #NNN"`.

## Code Reviews

Look at the area of code you're modifying, its history, and consider
tagging some of the [maintainers](https://u-root.tk/#contributors) when doing a
pull request in order to instigate some code review.

## Quality Controls

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/u-root/u-root) is used to test and build commits in a pull request.

See [.circleci/config.yml](.circleci/config.yml) for the CI commands run.
You can use [CircleCI's CLI tool](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/#run-a-job-in-a-container-on-your-machine) to run individual jobs from `.circlecl/config.yml` via Docker, eg. `circleci build --job test`.
