# Contributing Guidelines

We appreciate your interest in improving go-nfs!

## Looking for ways to contribute?

There are several ways you can contribute:
- Start contributing immediately via the [opened](https://github.com/willscott/go-nfs/issues) issues on GitHub.
  Defined issues provide an excellent starting point.
- Reporting issues, bugs, mistakes, or inconsistencies.
  As many open source projects, we are short-staffed, we thus kindly ask you to be open to contribute a fix for discovered issues.
