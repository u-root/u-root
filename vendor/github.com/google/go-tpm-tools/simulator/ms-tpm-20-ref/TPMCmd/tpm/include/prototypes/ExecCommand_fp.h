//** ExecuteCommand()
//
// The function performs the following steps.
//
//  a)  Parses the command header from input buffer.
//  b)  Calls ParseHandleBuffer() to parse the handle area of the command.
//  c)  Validates that each of the handles references a loaded entity.
//  d)  Calls ParseSessionBuffer () to:
//      1)  unmarshal and parse the session area;
//      2)  check the authorizations; and
//      3)  when necessary, decrypt a parameter.
//  e)  Calls CommandDispatcher() to:
//      1)  unmarshal the command parameters from the command buffer;
//      2)  call the routine that performs the command actions; and
//      3)  marshal the responses into the response buffer.
//  f)  If any error occurs in any of the steps above create the error response
//      and return.
//  g)  Calls BuildResponseSessions() to:
//      1)  when necessary, encrypt a parameter
//      2)  build the response authorization sessions
//      3)  update the audit sessions and nonces
//  h)  Calls BuildResponseHeader() to complete the construction of the response.
//
// 'responseSize' is set by the caller to the maximum number of bytes available in
// the output buffer. ExecuteCommand will adjust the value and return the number
// of bytes placed in the buffer.
//
// 'response' is also set by the caller to indicate the buffer into which
//  ExecuteCommand is to place the response.
//
//  'request' and 'response' may point to the same buffer
//
// Note: As of February, 2016, the failure processing has been moved to the
// platform-specific code. When the TPM code encounters an unrecoverable failure, it
// will SET g_inFailureMode and call _plat__Fail(). That function should not return
// but may call ExecuteCommand().
